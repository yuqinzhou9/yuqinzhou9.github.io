Hi! I am Yuqin Zhou, a second year Master's student in Information Technology and Cognition at the  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>. Prior to Copenhagen, I received my bachelor's degree in English (Linguistics track) from <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm">Tianjin University</a> in 2021.

My Master's thesis focuses on language modeling using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_network">tensor networks</a> supervised by Prof. <a href="http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~simonsen/">Jakob Grue Simonsen</a>.
