title: Neural Information Retrieval 
description: "[14 June 2022] This was my first individual course project in the field of NLP. Fortunately, my model performed best in the Neural information Retrieval course offered in 2022 at the University of Copenhagen."

#### Background

This project was completed under the guidance of the course, <a href="https://github.com/yuqinzhou9/course-neural_information_retrieval/blob/main/NIR_course_description.pdf">Neural Information Retrieval (NIR)</a>, in University of Copenhagen. The goal of this project was to design appropriate strategies for indexing and to explore text retrieval models.


This <a href="https://github.com/yuqinzhou9/course-neural_information_retrieval/blob/main/NIR%20report.pdf">course report</a> uses the NIR2022 dataset to evaluate various search algorithms: probabilistic and language models, divergence from randomness based models and neural retrieval models. In addition, query expansion techniques are used to improve effectiveness. The findings highlight the merit of embeddings, especially the direct use of them to compute similarities between queries and documents. The Cross-Encoder model using segments secured 1th position in the NIR course. The <a href="https://github.com/yuqinzhou9/course-neural_information_retrieval/tree/main/Code">code</a>  can be found here.
