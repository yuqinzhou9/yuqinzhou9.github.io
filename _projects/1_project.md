## background
This paper uses the NIR2022 dataset to eval- uate various search algorithms: probabilistic and language models, divergence from random- ness based models and neural retrieval models. In addition, query expansion techniques are used to improve effectiveness. The findings highlight the merit of embeddings, especially the direct use of them to compute similarities between queries and documents. The Cross- Encoder model using segments secured 1th po- sition in the NIR course.
